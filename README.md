# cScan
A program written in C that can demonstrate different scanning functions.

I used something similar in my Stock Manager project (available here on GitHub).
## Scan Functions
### Arrow Keys
You can use the arrow case to select a certain item with the provided function.
### Valid Dates
Can scan valid dates, refuse input when the date is invalid and also check for leap year dates.
### Decimal Numbers
Scans numeric decimal input into two different variables that represent whole numbers. Allows for the user to put a dot wherever during input.
## Input
Input is heavily moderated and the user is restricted from entering certain characters, as the program gets each character. This improves usability as users would not have to hit enter to detect a invalid character.
